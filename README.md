#Discord API Access
You will need to go to 
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
and create an application
Then use the create bot user option to create a bot

To add the bot to your discord server 
you will need the client id from the application registration page

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=>enter client ID here<&scope=bot&permissions=268561430

For example:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=201396576625754112&scope=bot&permissions=268561430
